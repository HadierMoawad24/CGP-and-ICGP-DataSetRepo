dataset of Choice-based Graphical Password CGP and Indexed Choice Based Graphical Password ICGP.
GP is still not widely utilized in the real world because consumers suffer from multiple login stages and have resorted to the textual password. 
A novel Choice-Based Graphical Password (CGP) Scheme for Web Applications is proposed. 
The scheme is a two-level multifactor authentication: textual and recognition.
During CGP registration, the user first registered his/her data, and then the system assigned him/her a random and unique number. The second, user chose an image from CGP's dataset or from his/her device. 
CGP then resized and blurred the user-selected image before encrypting and storing it in the CGP database.
The attacker claimed that the image was one element, but it was a combination of five factors (user name, user number, and his/her registered image with the same name, size, and resolution), making it difficult to guess and resistant to several attacks using The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC).
A novel scheme, an Indexed Choice-Based Graphical Password (ICGP). 
ICGP consisted of two operations: registration and authentication. 
At ICGP registration, the user registered his/her data and chose an image from a grid of images, then entered a number called Index Number IN used for choosing his/her password image to log in. 
After completing registration, ICGP gave the user a random and unique number, UNo then connected it with his/her name to be his/her ID.
Every login user chose a different image from the grid based on the random appearance of his/her registered image placed on the grid plus his/her registered IN. 
The ICGP password combines three factors; the user's name, UNo, and any image. According to the experiments, the novel ICGP proposed has improved compared to prior methods.
